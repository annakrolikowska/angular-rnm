#  Rick and Morty


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/0RXd0WDs/giard.png'> 


This is an application that uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). It features Characters, Episodes, and Locations tabs, where elements from the API are displayed. Additionally, after logging in, users gain access to the Watch List tab, where they can create their own watchlists and add episodes to them. Each episode can later be marked as watched or removed from the list.

Authentication is handled via **Firebase**, allowing users to create an account or log in using Google Sign-In. Watchlists are stored in **Firestore** as collections. The project was built using the **Angular** framework.
